# Pose Anything: A Graph-Based Approach for Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation
By Or Hirschorn and Shai Avidan


This repo is the official implementation of "[Pose Anything: A Graph-Based Approach for Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation]()".

## Introduction

We present a novel approach to CAPE that leverages the inherent geometrical relations between keypoints through a newly designed Graph Transformer Decoder. By capturing and incorporating this crucial structural information, our method enhances the accuracy of keypoint localization, marking a significant departure from conventional CAPE techniques that treat keypoints as isolated entities.

Code and model weights will be available in the near future.
